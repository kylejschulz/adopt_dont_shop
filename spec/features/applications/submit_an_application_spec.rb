Submit an Application

As a visitor
When I visit an application's show page
And I have added one or more pets to the application
Then I see a section to submit my application
And in that section I see an input to enter why I would make a good owner for these pet(s)
When I fill in that input
And I click a button to submit this application
Then I am taken back to the application's show page
And I see an indicator that the application is "Pending"
And I see all the pets that I want to adopt
And I do not see a section to add more pets to this application
