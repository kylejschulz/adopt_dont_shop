# Searching for Pets for an Application
#
# As a visitor
# When I visit an application's show page
# And that application has not been submitted,
# Then I see a section on the page to "Add a Pet to this Application"
# In that section I see an input where I can search for Pets by name
# When I fill in this field with a Pet's name
# And I click submit,
# Then I am taken back to the application show page
# And under the search bar I see any Pet whose name matches my search
